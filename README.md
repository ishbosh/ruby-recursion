# ruby-recursion
Project: Recursion in Ruby - assignment from The Odin Project


Assignment 1 - Fibonacci Sequence
- Using iteration, write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence. 
  Using an example input of 8, this method should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].

- Now write another method #fibs_rec which solves the same problem recursively. This can be done in just 3 lines


Assignment 2 - Merge Sort
 - Build a method #merge_sort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
